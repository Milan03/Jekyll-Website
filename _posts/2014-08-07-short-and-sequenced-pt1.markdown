This post will discuss the idea of incorporating short rest periods not only in between sets of exercises but in between the exercises themselves. This method of training may be applied to single muscle groups or incorporated as a full body exercise routine. The former focuses on hypertrophy, or muscle-mass building as well as muscular endurance over a period of time on the particular muscle group being trained. The latter may be seen as a way to execute full body routines that benefit muscle growth and general cardiovascular health. This training requires an intermediate level of experience with physical training and good cardiovascular capacity.

The first variation I will go into will be of incorporating this method within one muscle group a time. The variables of sets/reps may be applied in either a muscular endurance or muscular hypertrophy end-goal. Short rest periods will inherently contribute to muscular endurance as you are giving your body less time to recover in between sets therefore the body works to improve the time needed to recover in order to keep up. Applying strength training principles in combination with short rest intervals will offer the body near maximal effort with short recovery time, therefore increasing muscular endurance at near maximal levels.

To get an idea of what I am trying to get across I will exemplify a leg workout applied to this method.

Exercise         | Weight     | Sets    | Reps | Rest Interval |
:--------------  | :--------- | :-----: | :--: | :------------:|
Back Squats      | 75% of max |	 5	    |  5   |	 1min       |
Leg Press	     | Heavy	  |  5	    |  6   |	 45sec      |
Broad Jumps	     | BW	      |  3	    |  8   |    30sec      |
Goblet Squats    | Moderate	  |  3	    |  12  |    45sec      |
BB Front Squats  | Heavy	  |  3	    |  5   |    1min       |

The idea behind this sort of workout is to keep the intervals short even in between exercises. I like to stick to 1 minute max in between each exercise. You may also opt to set a time that you would like to finish a set amount of exercises and just use a countdown if you are experienced enough to challenge yourself.
This modality of training really keeps you in a focused state of mind as you are continually focused on either your current set or anticipating the next. It is a good way to change up a hypertrophy style bodybuilding routine with functional cardiovascular and strength endurance benefits.
